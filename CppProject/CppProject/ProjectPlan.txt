Ido Folkman C++ Project Plan:

Data Structures: due - 18 july - done

Node: Represents a node in the graph.
Graph: Represents the graph itself, containing nodes and edges.
Edge: Represents a connection between two nodes with an associated weight.


JSON Parsing: due - 25 july - done

CSV Parser: Reads the graph data from a CSV file and populates the graph data structure.


Graph Algorithms: due - 1 august

Shortest Path Algorithm: Implements an algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes.


Input/Output Handling: due - 8 august

User Input: Takes input from the user for the source and destination nodes.
Output: Displays the shortest path and its cost.



Main Program Flow: due - 1 September

Initialize the graph from the CSV file.
Accept user input for the nodes.
Compute the shortest path.
Display the result.
