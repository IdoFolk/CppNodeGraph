C++ node graph data structure by Ido Folkman

HOW TO RUN:

1. place a .csv file in the build folder formatted as the following:
 - each line represents a node in the graph 
 - the first cell in the line represents the node ID
 - the following cells in that line represents all the connected nodes IDs.

2. run the .exe file in the Build folder and write the name of the file you've placed in that folder (including .csv). 

3. write a starting and destination node IDs that are in the graph you've supplied to find the sortest path between them.

note. the weights between the nodes are randomly distributed.
